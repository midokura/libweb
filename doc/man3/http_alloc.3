.SH NAME
http_alloc \- allocate a HTTP context object

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <slweb/http.h>
.P
struct http *http_alloc(const struct http_cfg *\fIcfg\fP);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR http_alloc (3)
function allocates a
.I "struct http_ctx"
object, containing the required data by
.I slweb
to handle a HTTP connection. This object is meant to be consumed by
other functions from
.IR slweb .
.I cfg
defines the configuration for the HTTP context, whose structure is defined by
.IR slweb_http (7).

.I "struct http_ctx"
is an opaque object internal to
.I slweb
and therefore is not accessible to callers.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, an opaque pointer to a
.I struct http_ctx
object is returned. On error,
a null pointer is returned, and
.I errno
might be set by the internal call to
.IR malloc (3).

.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR malloc (3)
for a list of possible errors.

.SH NOTES
This function is designed for internal use by
\fIslweb\fR.
